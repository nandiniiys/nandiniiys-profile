# Personal Website (React)

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **React** and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.  
ðŸ”— **Live site:** [https://nandiniiys.github.io/nandiniiys-profile](https://nandiniiys.github.io/nandiniiys-profile)

## About

The site serves as a personal hub to showcase:
- **Home** â€“ quick intro  
- **Experience** â€“ industry background  
- **Projects** â€“ highlights of selected projects  
- **Blogs** â€“ short writeups (PDFs linked in tiles)  
- **Research** â€“ academic research  
- **Contact** â€“ ways to reach me  

The layout is simple and reusable, making it easy to adapt this structure for any personal portfolio.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
```
The site is deployed via the gh-pages package.
```bash
npm run deploy
```
This builds the app and pushes the static files to the gh-pages branch.
Make sure the "homepage" field in package.json points to your GitHub Pages URL.
